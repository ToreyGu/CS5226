Primary power supply and secondary power supply switching design
When the main power supply is accessed, the secondary power supply MOS tube is turned off and does not supply power to the system, when the main power supply is not accessed, the negative power supply will be used as a standby power supply, it is recommended to use the main power supply to reduce power consumption and increase the service life.
主电源副电源切换设计
当主电源接入时，副电源MOS管关断，不向系统供电，当主电源未接入时，负电源将作为备用电源供电，建议使用主电源供电以降低功耗和增加系统使用寿命

Interface Design
Interface using standard interface, PCB design impedance and interface standard impedance matching can be
接口设计
接口使用标准接口，PCB设计时阻抗与接口标准的阻抗匹配即可

Forward and reverse insertion design
As this chip program does not have forward and reverse insertion detection function, you need to add another low-cost MCU to detect forward and reverse insertion, do not detect forward and reverse insertion can be disregarded.
正反插设计
由于本芯片方案没有正反插检测功能，需要另加一片低成本MCU检测正反插，不检测正反插可以不予考虑
